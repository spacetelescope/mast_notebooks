    "### 1.1 Introduction to _Kepler_ photometry\n",
    "\n",
    "When you search for _Kepler_ or _K2_ light curves in the data archive, you can either access simple aperture photometry (SAP) light curves (for example, see the [_Kepler_ Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19081-003-KDPH.pdf), Section 6.3.6), or presearch data conditioning simple aperture photometry (PDCSAP) light curves (for example, [Stumpe et al., 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1382.pdf), [Smith et al., 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1383.pdf)). You can also access the orignal target pixel files (TPFs) from which such light curves were extracted. TPFs are useful for inspecting the calibrated pixels, but when you're doing science, you usually just want to look at a light curve. This tutorial covers how to use TPFs to _create_ light curves. There are many reasons why you might want to produce your own light curve, which we'll cover in [Section 1.3](#1.3-Why-don't-we-just-use-the-data-from-MAST?). But more fundamentally, it's important to know how the data you're using is produced. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of photometry and then learn how to apply it to _Kepler_ TPFs, producing light curves just like the ones produced by the official _Kepler_ pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into it, it's important to note that we're only going to be performing photometry on one quarter at a time. Combining _Kepler_ Quarters is not trivial: because the telescope rotated by 90° every quarter, the same star would fall on different pixels every fourth quarter. Different pixels have different sensitivities, so the size of the TPFs downloaded for a single target changes between adjacent quarters. It's certainly possible to combine multiple quarters of *Kepler* data, or campaigns of _K2_ data, and you can read more about it in a different tutorial. We won't cover quarter stitching here, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also won't cover systematics correction in this tutorial. Light curves created using custom aperture photometry will still include systematic noise from various sources, such as spacecraft motion. You can read more about noise and noise corrections in other tutorials in this series."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to explore photometry in a practical context by creating our own time series data. But first, we'll go through a quick introduction of some of the theory behind it. Photometry is defined as the process of measuring the brightness of an astronomical object. Specifically, we'll be doing time series photometry: measuring that brightness over time. Telescopes like _Kepler_ use charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras ([_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19033-002-instrument-hb.pdf), Section 4) to take images of their targets at regular intervals — this interval is known as the cadence — and we perform photometry to turn each image into a flux measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In _Kepler_ and _K2_ data, each targeted object has a TPF, which is used to store the raw pixel data from which a light curve can be produced. _Kepler_'s pixels are 4x4 arcseconds large, and all stars take up less angular space than this as point sources in the sky. So, theoretically, we could track the flux of a single pixel over time, and call that our light curve. But light that falls on a CCD is spread onto surrounding pixels, proportional to its brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at a TPF to see what a star actually looks like in _Kepler_ pixel data. The following line of code downloads the 30-minute long cadence light curve for KIC 7461601 from MAST. You can read more about using Lightkurve to download data in a separate tutorial."

    "You can see how the light from this star is spread out across the TPF. The process of choosing which pixels to use for photometry is referred to as defining an aperture. By adding together the flux in multiple pixels, we get a more accurate measurement of the object's brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPFs are designed to be big enough such that the vast majority of a target's flux is captured within the available pixels. Because light from a star doesn't spread out like a rectangle (we'll talk about this more below), each TPF has pixels which we won't need to use for our photometry. In the example above, the star has a [_Kepler_ magnitude](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/the-kepler-space-telescope.html#flux-calibration) of 13.4; this is analogous to a visual magnitude, and defined based on higher resolution photometry taken prior to the _Kepler_ mission. For a star this bright, we can pick out six pixels by eye that almost certainly contain signal. Fainter targets are spread out across fewer pixels, and brighter targets may cover well over 20 pixels. Extremely bright targets will saturate the detector, making it very hard to perform photometry on them. We won't be covering saturated stars in this tutorial; if you're interested in working with them, the [Halophot](https://github.com/hvidy/halophot/) Python package is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about the pixels we don't use? Think of a grainy photograph: we observe the same thing in all CCD data, but it's harder to recognize by eye in photographs from telescopes with large pixels. This grainy noise is called \"shot noise,\" and arises from fluctuations in the current that powers an electronic photon-collecting device. For aperture photometry, we need to worry about shot noise because it dominates what we see in the \"background\" of an image, that is, the light we see in pixels that don't have any light from our target. In reality, most pixels will be some kind of combination of \"signal\" and \"background.\" When we choose our aperture for photometry, we're looking to optimize the amount of signal we collect, and minimize the noise contribution from the background.\n",

    "You might not expect the star's aperture to be this shape — stars are point sources, after all. In many cases, stars in _Kepler_ will look circular, as we'd expect. However, at the edge of the focal plane, some targets may appear smeared in one direction. And even for a star with circular spread, the aperture may be a different shape. The way the spread of light interacts with the detector is defined by something called the point spread function (PSF), or pixel response function (PRF). _Kepler_'s PSF/PRF is described in detail in Section 3.5 of the [_Kepler_ Instrument Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've looked at a basic example in this section, but as we'll see later in this tutorial, it can be hard to determine the best aperture for a given target by eye. Choosing the best aperture for your target can be something of a balancing act: using a larger aperture will minimize the effects of PSF changes and spacecraft motion, but conversely it increases the presence of shot noise. This is why _Kepler_ and _K2_ data were processed with an \"optimal aperture.\" Brightness, PSF, shot noise, crowding, and many other factors went into predicting the optimal aperture for producing a SAP or PDCSAP light curve with NASA's _Kepler_ and _K2_ pipelines. You can read more about the process of creating these apertures in [Smith et al., 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PASP..128l4501S/abstract), which is equivalent to Chapter 7 of the [_Kepler_ Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19081-003-KDPH.pdf)."

    "### 1.3 Why not just use published light curves?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we might want to create our own light curve from scratch, rather than using the readily available data. One of the main reasons is contamination: particularly in crowded fields, we might find multiple signals in one light curve, meaning there are multiple targets in the TPF. In that case, we would want to make our own light curve using a smaller aperture, to make sure that we're only picking up the signal from our target star. Alternatively, we might want to use our TPF to produce a serendipitous light curve for a contaminating star, especially if it doesn't have its own SAP/PDCSAP light curve available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason we might want to produce our own light curves is to minimize noise. Recall that some pixels might be dominated by shot noise over signal. If we find that some of the pixels in a _Kepler_ pipeline aperture have more noise than signal, we can make our own aperture to see what happens if we exclude those pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we might want to produce a light curve for a star that doesn't have SAP/PDCSAP data available at all. This could be a star in the full-frame images (FFIs), or the superstamps ([_Kepler_ Archive Manual](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/archive_manual.pdf), Sections 2.3.3 and 2.2.1). This is less likely to come up with _Kepler/K2_ data, but all of these tools will come in handy when working with _TESS_ full-frame images. There are hundreds of thousands of stars in the _TESS_ field of view that weren't targeted and don't have readily available light curves. Custom aperture photometry is perfectly suited for inspecting individual targets in the _TESS_ FFIs."

    "### 1.4 Choosing an aperture\n",
    "\n",
    "In NASA's _Kepler_ and _K2_ pipelines, the process of determining apertures is automated ([_Kepler_ Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19081-003-KDPH.pdf), Part II). Here, we'll manually create our own apertures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any knowledge of which pixels contain light from our target, the most basic approach is to look at individual pixels and manually determine which pixels to work with. Working offline, we can use Lightkurve's TPF `interact()` function, which is a convenient way to inspect one or more pixels at a time. Another recommended way to define an aperture is by defining a median flux value and only selecting pixels at a certain sigma above that threshold. In the tutorial, we'll look at using Lightkurve's built-in functionality to perform this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most situations, a threshold mask will be the best choice for custom aperture photometry, as it doesn't involve trial and error beyond finding the best sigma value. However, if you're dealing with multiple bright objects in one TPF, a manual mask may be the better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods are most useful when dealing with small amounts of data, such as looking at a handful of individual objects. When working with large datasets, it's advisable to use the pipeline aperture, as this will be sufficient in the majority of cases with _Kepler_ and _K2_. However, if you're processing a large amount of stars which were not targeted during either mission — such as FFI or superstamp data — a good approach would be to experiment with multiple threshold apertures for each target and see which one produces the best results."

    "Finally, it is good to know that there is interactive functionality in Lightkurve to create a mask.  We cannot demonstrate it in this static tutorial, but you can try it yourself in a local notebook by running `tpf.interact()`. This will bring up an interactive panel which allows you to select the pixels you want using mouse clicks. Next, press \"Save Lightcurve\" in the bottom left of the panel. This will export your custom aperture light curve to a FITS file in your working directory. The file name follows a similar convention to official _Kepler_ data products. For example, the file name for the example above is `kplr002437901-2011271113734_lpd-targ-custom-lc.fits`."
