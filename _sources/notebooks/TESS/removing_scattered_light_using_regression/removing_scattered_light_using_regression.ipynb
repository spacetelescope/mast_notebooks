    "Lightkurve offers several tools to the community for removing instrument noise and systematics from data from the *Kepler*, *K2*, and *TESS* missions. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of Lightkurve's `RegressionCorrector` class to remove the scattered light and spacecraft motion noise from *TESS* Full Frame Images (FFIs).\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to the corrector demonstrated in this tutorial, Lightkurve has a special case of `RegressionCorrector` called `PLDCorrector`. PLD, or Pixel Level Decorrelation, is a method of removing systematic noise from light curves using linear regression, with a design matrix constructed from a combination of pixel-level light curves. \n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we perform PLD and diagnose the correction in just three lines. To make a more direct comparison to the `RegressionCorrector`, we pass in arguments to set the number of components to five (as in section 2), as well as remove the spline fit."

    "While it is more convenient to apply to light curves and generally works well with default parameters, the `PLDCorrector` is less flexible than the `RegressionCorrector`, which allows you to create your own custom design matrix. However, the `PLDCorrector` also allows you to create \"higher order\" PLD regressors by taking the products of existing pixel regressors, which improves the performance of corrections to *K2* data (see the paper by [Luger et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00524) for more information).\n",
