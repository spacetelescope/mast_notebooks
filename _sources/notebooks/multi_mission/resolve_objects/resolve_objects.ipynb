    "When querying the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) using [`astroquery.mast`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html), it's common to search for data by specifying the name of a well-known astronomical object—such as [“M31”](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=M31) or [“Betelgeuse”](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Betelgeuse)—rather than providing precise celestial coordinates. For an in-depth discussion of how name resolution works, including potential pitfalls, resolver order, and real-world examples, see the [\"Searching for Named Sources\"](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Searching+for+Named+Sources) article in the MAST documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These name-based queries are handled by [SANTA, the STScI Archive Name Translation Application](https://mastresolver.stsci.edu/Santa-war/). SANTA resolves object names into celestial coordinates by querying a sequence of resolver services—including [SIMBAD](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/), [NED](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/), [TIC](https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-input-catalogue/), and others—until a match is found or all options are exhausted. Different resolvers may return slightly different positions for the same object due to variations in reference catalogs. These differences can impact which observations are returned from MAST, particularly when searching for angularly large sources using a narrow search radius. More dramatically, different resolvers may return completely different objects for the same name due to differing naming conventions. See the \n",
    "[\"Problem cases\" section of \"Searching for Named Sources\"](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/MASTDOCS/Searching+for+Named+Sources#SearchingforNamedSources-Problemcases) for more information.\n",

    "First, we'll demonstrate how to interact directly with the SANTA service using `astroquery.mast` before showing how to incorporate these settings into MAST queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with data from MAST, it's often helpful to resolve the name of an astronomical object into its celestial coordinates. The [`resolve_object`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html#resolving-object-names) function, available in any of the MAST query classes, provides a flexible way to do this. It queries the SANTA service and supports specifying a particular resolver or retrieving results from all available resolvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's resolve an object name using SANTA's default resolver sequence. We'll use the `Observations` class to do this, but you could also use `Catalogs`, `MastMissions`, or any other MAST query class. Below, we will resolve the name [\"NGC 1909\"](https://theskylive.com/sky/deepsky/ngc1909-witch-head-nebula-object), which refers to a [reflection nebula](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/reflection-nebula/) in the constellation of [Eridanus](https://noirlab.edu/public/education/constellations/eridanus/)."
