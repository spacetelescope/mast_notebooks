#  Welcome to the MAST Notebook Repository!

## Notebook Organization

To keep things as simple as possible, our Notebooks are mostly categorized by mission. In some cases, you may see a folder for a catalog or a MAST service. Within each "mission" folder, there are subfolders, one for each notebook. These subfolders make it easy to provide supplemental files, and keep your workflow tidy in the event a notebook downloads additional files.

## Acronyms

For full details about missions, including links to relevant documentation, please see the 'intro' file in the mission subfolders. Acronyms are defined here to eliminate any ambiguity or confusion.
