## Notebooks in this Section

The notebooks in this section demonstrate how to execute example science queries, grouped by technique & technical similarities. These queries are drawn from the 20 queries for SDSS as presented by [Gray, Szalay, et al. (2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0202014), adapted for the Pan-STARRS PS1 database. In all, this series of notebooks will present the 11 queries which are applicable for PS1.

The example queries here demonstrate how to perform queries requiring only filtering (with joins). |


More Pan-STARRS example query notebooks will be coming soon!
