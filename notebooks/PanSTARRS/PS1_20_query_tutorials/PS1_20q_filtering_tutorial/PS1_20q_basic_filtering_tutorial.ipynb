    "******\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a series demonstrating how to address a set of scientific questions using SQL-like Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) queries via a Virtual Observatory standard Table Access Protocol (TAP) service at MAST. \n",
    "\n",
    "This series aims to be an introduction to how complex queries can be executed using TAP (which might otherwise not be possible to specify with `astroquery`), and to be a resource for how to access MAST databases after the MAST CASJobs service is retired.\n",
    "\n",
    "These queries are drawn from the 20 queries for SDSS as presented by [Gray, Szalay, et al. (2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0202014), adapted for the Pan-STARRS PS1 database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the subset of queries which are possible through **filtering on column(s) using pre-specified criteria**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to design and perform filtering queries (with joins) using TAP services, by leveraging multiple ADQL \"WHERE\" contraints.\n",

Object positions (necessary for the RA coordinate restriction) are also available in this table (with the updated PS1 DR2 TAP service). \n",

    "\n",
    "The first constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "```((fmo.gFKronMag > 0) AND (fmo.gFPSFMag - fmo.gFKronMag > 0.05))```\n",

    "Finally, to ensure we limit the query to less than the maximum number of entries for a single TAP query, we further restrict the spatial coverage of this query to -30$^{\\circ}$$\\lesssim$decMean$\\lesssim$-28$^{\\circ}$.  Here we specify this by restricting the Pan-STARRS `objID` to be less than 74400000000000000 (as the first 5 digits of [Pan-STARRS object identifiers](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/spaces/Pan-STARRS/pages/298812384/PS1+Object+Identifiers) are determined from `floor((decl+90)/0.00833333)`."

    "\n",
    "This query, as implemented in Gray et al. for SDSS, is complex and difficult to replicate exactly (e.g., as the absorption/reddening tables are not available for Pan-STARRS). Thus here we implement similar color cuts to make this example comparable to the SDSS query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, PS1 does not have likelihoods for the de Vaucouleurs versus Sersic morphological fits, so instead heuristic criteria are applied. If the Sersic fit failed, or if it has a higher chi-square value than the de Vaucouleurs fit, then we assume the galaxy is best fit by the de Vaucouleurs profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires combining the following [tables](link_to_migration_guide):\n",

    "- `stack_object`: Kron magnitudes in `gri` for color & magnitude constraints (used in place of Petrosian magnitudes, as the PS1 documentation states Petrosian magnitudes are unreliable), Kron radius `rKronRad` to get size, Galactic latitude `b`, to avoid the Milky Way Galactic plane (where dust and foreground stars would impact measurements)\n",
    "- `stack_model_fit_ser`: Sersic fits, including chi-square\n",
    "- `stack_model_fit_de_v`: de Vaucouleurs fits, including chi-square\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we perform quality control by requiring `stack_object.nDetections>3` and `stack_object.nr>1` (number of detections total and in the `r` band; and the same in the `g` and `i` bands), and `stack_object.rpsfQfPerfect>0.9` (and the same in the `g` and `i` bands) to weed out some bad objects. We also require `stack_model_fit_de_v.gDevChisq>0` (and similarly for `r` and `i`) to ensure the de Vaucouleurs fit has at least minimal quality. Finally, we use PSF and Kron magnitude differences to select for galaxies (excluding point sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to ensure the query does not exceed the time or maximum row limit for a single TAP query, we further restrict this query to Pan-STARRS slice 16 (by requiring `objID` to be between 129500000000000000 and 133500000000000000)."
