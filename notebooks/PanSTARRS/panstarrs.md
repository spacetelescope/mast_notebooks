# Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)

## What is Pan-STARRS?
[Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)](http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/) is a system for wide-field astronomical imaging developed 
and operated by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii.
Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) is the first part of Pan-STARRS to be completed and is the basis 
for both Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1 and DR2). 
The PS1 survey used a 1.8 meter telescope and its 1.4 Gigapixel camera (GPC1; see 
[PS1 GPC1 camera](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/spaces/PANSTARRS/pages/298812301/PS1+GPC1+camera)) 
to image the sky in five broadband [filters](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/PS1+Filter+properties) (g, r, i, z, y). The PS1 Science Consortium funded the operation of the Pan-STARRS1 telescope, situated at Haleakala Observatories near the summit of 
Haleakala in Hawaii, for the purposes of astronomical research. 
The PS1 consortium is made up of astronomers and engineers from 
[14 institutions from six countries](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/spaces/PANSTARRS/pages/298812469/PS1+Science+Consortium+-+PS1SC). 

The data from PS1 are archived at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/) (STScI) in Baltimore Maryland, and can be accessed through MAST, the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (see the [Pan-STARRS1 Data Archive](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/Pan-STARRS1+data+archive+home+page)). Additional support for the PS1 public science archive is provided by the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/).
