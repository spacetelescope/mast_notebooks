# Instrumental Noise
These notebooks form a four-part series on instrument noise in Kepler.

| Notebook                                      | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Gaps and Quality Flags                | Identify the reasons for gaps in the data and what it means to have a 'Quality Flag'.  |
| Spurious Signals and Time-Sampling Effects | Understand the cause of spurious signals and which products are affected.              |
| Seasonal and Detector Effects              | Learn about the effects of seasonal cycles and "ghost images" on data.                 |
| Electronic Noise                           | Understand the impacts of crosstalk, rolling bands, and cosmic rays on observations.   |
