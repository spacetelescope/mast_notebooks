# Identifying Periodic Signals

These tutorials look at some types of periodic signals you might find in Kepler data.

| Identifying Transiting Planets                | Use the [Box Least Squares (BLS)](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/bls.html) method to identify transiting planet signals in light curves.                                                                |
| Removing Rotation Signals                     | Not every oscillating signal is a planet; a key factor in stellar brightness is the star itself! This Notebook focuses on the impact of stellar rotation on a lightcurve, and how to create a model for this rotation. |
| Visualizing Periodic Signals with River Plots | A river plot is a method of visualizing a periodic signal that changes over time. In this lesson, we'll use a multi-planetary system to look at a planet with a non-constant period.                                   |
| Verifying Signal Location in Pixel Data       | Learn to decontaminate data, even in a crowded field, by performing a pixel-level analysis of the data.                                                                                                                |
