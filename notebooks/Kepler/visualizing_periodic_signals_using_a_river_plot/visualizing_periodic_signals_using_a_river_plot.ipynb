    "\n",
    "A \"river plot\" is a method to visualize periodic signals that vary over time. It is created by breaking a light curve into segments of equal length, such as the period of a planet orbiting a star, and displaying the segments side by side to allow the flux values to be compared. This allows you to examine how an entire light curve varies relative to a fixed period. It is similar to a \"[waterfall plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_plot)\" which is used to similarly analyze time variation in spectra. \n",
