By doing so they observe how the brightnesses of stars change over time.\n",

    "Pixels around targeted stars are cut out and stored as *target pixel files* at each observing cadence. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Lightkurve to download and understand the different photometric data stored in a target pixel file, and how to extract flux using basic aperture photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to read the accompanying tutorial discussing how to use target pixel file products with Lightkurve before starting this tutorial. It is recommended that you also read the tutorial on using *Kepler* light curve products with Lightkurve, which will introduce you to some specifics on how *Kepler*, *K2*, and *TESS* make observations, and how these are displayed as light curves. It also introduces some important terms and concepts that are referred to in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kepler* observed a single field in the sky, although not all stars in this field were recorded. Instead, pixels were selected around certain targeted stars. These cutout images are called target pixel files, or TPFs. By  combining the amount of flux in the pixels where the star appears, you can make a measurement of the amount of light from a star in that observation. The pixels chosen to include in this measurement are referred to as an *aperture*.\n",
    "\n",
    "TPFs are typically the first port of call when studying a star with *Kepler*, *K2*, or *TESS*. They allow us to see where our data is coming from, and identify potential sources of noise or systematic trends. In this tutorial, we will use the *Kepler* mission as the main example, but these tools equally apply to *TESS* and *K2* as well."
