| Searching for Kepler/K2 Data Using Lightkurve          | Learn about Kepler data products, and how to query for and download them.                                                                                          |
| Creating Light Curves Using Custom Aperture Photometry | Create your own custom light curves from Kepler images.                                                                                                            |
| Combining Multiple Quarters of Data                    | Learn about Kepler Quarters and how this division of observations impacts the data. Then, combine Quarters to create a longer light curve.                         |
| Interactively Inspecting TPFs and Light Curves         | One of the most powerful features of lightkurve is the ability to make data interactive. This tutorial will walk you through some of the most interesting options. |
