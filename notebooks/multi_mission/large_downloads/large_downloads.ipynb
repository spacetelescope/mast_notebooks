    "# Large Downloads in `astroquery.mast`\n",
    "***\n",
    "For some programs stored in the MAST Archive, you may encounter issues when downloading data via the MAST Portal due to a large number of files. This applies particularly to JWST programs using Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy. It is preferable — and often, necessary — to use an API to get this data instead. In this tutorial, we'll use seemingly innocuous observations that expand into a considerable number of related files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, this notebook will demonstrate:\n",
    "* Searching the MAST Portal for observations using the [astroquery.mast](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) API\n",
    "* Retreiving associated data products, without causing a timeout error\n",
    "* Downloading the desired subset of data products\n",

    "The first step to downloading the data is finding the observations we're interested in.

When querying for JWST data, using `obs_collection = 'JWST'` greatly inreases the speed of the search by decreasing the number of potential matches. This applies to all mission available in MAST, including HST."
