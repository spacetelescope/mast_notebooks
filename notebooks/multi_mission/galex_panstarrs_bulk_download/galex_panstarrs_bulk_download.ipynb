    "Several MAST datasets are now available from the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/), a cloud data storage service. These datasets [include data from JWST, HST, TESS, Pan-STARRS, GALEX, and Kepler/K2](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/stsci/). In this notebook, you'll learn how to download data in bulk to your local machine's storage from two large survey missions, GALEX and Pan-STARRS (PS1).\n",

    "To give some more context on the missions we'll be focusing on:\n",
    "* [Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/galex) was a NASA mission led by the California Institute of Technology, whose primary goal was to investigate how star formation in galaxies evolved from the early Universe up to the present. GALEX used microchannel plate detectors to obtain direct images in the near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV), and a grism to disperse light for low resolution spectroscopy. \n",
    "* [Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/) is a system for wide-field astronomical imaging developed and operated by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) is the first part of Pan-STARRS to be completed.  The PS1 survey used a 1.8 meter telescope and its 1.4 Gigapixel camera to image the sky in five broadband filters (g, r, i, z, y)."
