    "# **GALEX and Pan-STARRS Bulk Download through AWS**\n",
    "This notebook seeks to enhance the **Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes** (**MAST**) user experience for astronomers and scientists such that they can download mission specific data seamlessly! This notebook will help any astronomers with downloading data from two specific missions: `GALEX` and `Pan-STARRS (PS1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give some more context:\n",
    "* [Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/galex) was a space telescope managed primarily by JPL/CalTech that was launched in 2003. GALEX was launched on an Orbital Sciences Corporation (defunct) Pegasus launch vehicle, which one can view at the Smithsonian in Sterling, VA. GALEX operated in the ultraviolet wavelength and was used to study galaxys' star formation from the early universe to the present. GALEX was decommissioned in 2013 and it's data is archived at MAST.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS)](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/PANSTARRS/) is located at Haleakala Oberservatory in Hawaii, US and surveys the sky for moving objects. Pan-STARRS was originally a collaboration between various academic institutions and the U.S. Air Force, given that the work has both scientific and defense/national security implications. The first Pan-STARRS telescope (PS1) has two data releases: DR1 and DR2 that we host here at MAST. DR2 is considered one of the largest astronomical datasets ever."

    "# Learning Goals\n",
    "By using this notebook, an astronomer or scientist will:\n",
    "* Understand that downloading data and files in bulk from AWS is feasible and possibly easier than going through the MAST portal.\n",
    "* Make targeted queries to MAST using parameters such as: `right ascension`, `declination`, `observation` and more.\n",
    "* Filter the resulting products by using parameters such as: `productType`, `productSubGroupDescription`, `productGroupDescription`, `mrp_only`, and more.\n",
    "* Use this notebook to programmatically download *.fits* files locally to their computer. Once the *.fits* files are downloaded locally, the researcher can experiment, prototype, and do research much easier."

    "This notebook contains some sample code to bulk download files from MAST, with examples provided for `GALEX` and  `Pan-STARRS (PS1)`. This notebook can be generalized to query data from other missions too such as: `SWIFT`, `HST`, or `IUE`. Please feel free to modify the code to your particular use case!

    "* The `Observations` API from *astroquery.mast* can be used to query MAST data, specifically it allows you to query data from CAOM. CAOM is a observational database that houses metadata from multiple missions at the same time, from legacy missions to currently operational missions.\n",

    "* There is also another `MastMissions` API from *astroquery.mast* that can be used to query MAST data. This API is more limited in scope and only supports querying data from the missions: `HST`, `JWST`, `CLASSY`, and `ULLYSES`. This notebook will not demonstrate the capabilities of the `MastMissions` API. Rather, please refer to the excellent notebook: [**Searching for Mission-Specific Data with Astroquery**](https://spacetelescope.github.io/mast_notebooks/notebooks/multi_mission/missions_mast_search/missions_mast_search.html) - Sam Bianco if you wanty to learn more about the `MastMissions` API.
