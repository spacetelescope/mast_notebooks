    "When querying the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) using [`astroquery.mast`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html), it's common to search for data by specifying the name of a well-known astronomical object—such as [“M31”](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-31/) or [“Betelgeuse”](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/what-is-betelgeuse-inside-the-strange-volatile-star/)—rather than providing precise celestial coordinates. These name-based queries are handled by [SANTA, the STScI Archive Name Translation Application](https://mastresolver.stsci.edu/Santa-war/).\n",
    "\n",
    "SANTA resolves target names into celestial coordinates by querying a sequence of resolver services—including [Simbad](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basicIdent=m33&submit=SIMBAD+search), [NED](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/), [TIC](https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-input-catalogue/), and others—until a match is found or all options are exhausted. Different resolvers may return slightly different positions for the same object due to variations in reference catalogs or naming conventions. These differences can impact which observations are returned from MAST, particularly when searching within a narrow radius.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use `astroquery.mast` to resolve named objects and configure the resolver used in our queries."

    "## Resolving an Object\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with data from MAST, it's often helpful to resolve the name of an astronomical object into its celestial coordinates. The [`resolve_object`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html#resolving-object-names) function, available in any of the MAST query classes, provides a flexible way to do this. It queries the SANTA service and supports specifying a particular resolver or retrieving results from all available resolvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's resolve a target name using SANTA's default resolver sequence. We'll use the `Observations` class to do this, but you could also use `Catalogs`, `MastMissions`, or any other MAST query class. Below, we will resolve the name [\"NGC 1909\"](https://theskylive.com/sky/deepsky/ngc1909-witch-head-nebula-object), which refers to a [reflection nebula](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/reflection-nebula/) in the constellation of [Eridanus](https://noirlab.edu/public/education/constellations/eridanus/)."

The results will be slightly different, as each resolver uses a different reference catalog and naming convention."
