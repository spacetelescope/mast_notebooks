    "- Know the requirements for generating a telescope footprint\n",
    "- Create a plot of a footprint in the telescope's reference frame\n",
    "- Create a plot of a footprint on the sky\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Notebook is a replacement for a web-based footprint viewer, and is designed as a \"quick look\" tool. Scientists intending to propose for Observations should use the [Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT)](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/astronomers-proposal-tool-apt).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since [PySIAF](https://pysiaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) covers only HST, JWST, and Roman, footprints for other telescopes cannot be generated using this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "- `ipyaladin` plots the footprints on to a survey background\n",
    "- `numpy` is not listed in the import cell, but is necessary to run the `selectSIAF` script\n",
    "- `selectSIAF` is a script that uses `SIAF` to generate the telescope aperture names. Curious readers may wish to explore this file.\n",
    "-  `SIAF` will translate the telescope pointing into corresponding sky footprints\n",
    "-  `time` adds a pause to give Aladin time to load"
