    "The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) provides a suite of cutout services for several space telescope missions and use-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [<b>HAPCut Service</b>](https://mast.stsci.edu/hapcut/) : Generates cutouts out of [Hubble Advanced Products (HAPs)](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/HAdP/Improvements+in+HST+Astrometry) available in MAST.\n",
    "* [<b>TESSCut Service</b>](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/docs/index.html) : Generates cutouts out of TESS mission full frame images (namely [TESS-SPOC](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/pipeline.html) and [TICA](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica)).\n",
    "* [<b>ZCut Service</b>](https://mast.stsci.edu/zcut/) : Generates cutouts out of MAST-supported deep field surveys (e.g. CANDELS, 3D-HST).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these services can be accessed through a standard GET request to their respective APIs, but they can also be accessed via the `astroquery.mast` module through their respective classes: `astroquery.mast.Hapcut`, `astroquery.mast.Tesscut` and `astroquery.mast.Zcut`. In this notebook, we will walk through two examples: one where we access the TESSCut service with `astroquery.mast.Tesscut`, and one where we access the HAPCut service with `astroquery.mast.Hapcut`. A separate notebook has already been made demonstrating how to access the ZCut service with `astroquery.mast.Zcut`, and is available [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/mast_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/astroquery/beginner_zcut/beginner_zcut.ipynb).\n",
