    "## Introduction \n",
    "The Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram was independently discovered by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell in the early 20th century. This diagram effectively plots a star's theoretical luminosity against its temperature.\n",
    "By examining the position of stars on the HR diagram, we can infer stellar properties such as age, metallicity, or mass. An HR Diagram is also useful for tracking the life cycle of stars. Stars in their hydrogen-core burning phases evolve leftwards on the HR diagram. Eventually, they leave the main sequence to start their red giant phases and move upwards as they begin burning helium in their cores [[1]](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "An observational variation of the HR Diagram is the *Color-Magnitude Diagram* (CMD), which uses color (a proxy for temperature) and magnitude (a proxy for luminosity). We can use photometric data from a star cluster to create a CMD, and then estimate the age by comparing the main sequence tracks and red giant branch to theoretical isochrones — curves that represent stars of the same age but with different masses, mapping their expected positions at various evolutionary stages. For example, an older cluster will have more stars on the red giant branch whereas a younger cluster will have more stars on the main sequence. The transition between the two evolutionary stages, called the *Main Sequence Turn-Off*, is the key to determining the age of a stellar cluster [[2]](https://astronomyonline.org/Astrophotography/CMDDiagram.asp)\n",

    "Messier 13 (M13) is a globular cluster located in the constellation Hercules [[4]](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-13/). M13 is estimated to contain over 100,000 stars with a total metallicity ([Fe/H]) of approximately -1.33 dex [[5]](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/404/3/1203/1049211?login=true#92596831). This is consistent with the ancient stellar populations found in other globular clusters [[6]](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/star-clusters-inside-the-universes-stellar-collections/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll estimate the age of M13 using photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's (SDSS) Legacy Imaging Survey and stellar isochrones from the PARSEC database [[7]](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/09/aa44166-22/aa44166-22.html). By plotting isochrone tracks for a range of ages and comparing them to the observed stellar distribution of M13, we can identify the isochrone that best fits the cluster's data and thereby estimate its age.\n"
