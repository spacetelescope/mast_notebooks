# Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

## What is SDSS?
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an international collaboration producing wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopic surveys since 1998. The [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/sdss) is the collection of science-ready SDSS data which is hosted at MAST. This includes images, spectra, catalogs and Value Added Catalogs (VACs) from all public SDSS data releases through SDSS-V.

## For Further Reading
The [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST User Manual](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/SDSS/The+SDSS+Legacy+Archive+at+MAST) website contains summary information, data product overviews, descriptions of MAST tools, and tutorials on how to interact with SDSS data at MAST.

For more general information relating to SDSS, the documentation is available at [www.sdss.org](https://www.sdss.org)

| [MaNGA and HST Tutorial](https://github.com/spacetelescope/mast_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/SDSS/MaNGA_HST_tutorial/MaNGA_HST_tutorial.ipynb) | Tutorial for how to search and download MaNGA data at MAST using `astroquery.mast`. Combines H-alpha emission maps from MaNGA and images from HST to make galaxy maps for for interacting galaxy pair Mrk-848B. |
| [APOGEE and TESS Tutorial](https://github.com/spacetelescope/mast_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/SDSS/APOGEE_TESS_tutorial/APOGEE_TESS_tutorial.ipynb) | Tutorial for how to search and download APOGEE data at MAST using `astroquery.mast`. Combines infrared spectra from APOGEE and corresponding lightcurves from TESS to characterize different types of variable stars. |
| [eBOSS and JWST Tutorial](https://github.com/spacetelescope/mast_notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/SDSS/eBOSS_JWST_tutorial/eBOSS_JWST_tutorial.ipynb) | Tutorial for how to search and download eBOSS data at MAST using `astroquery.mast`. Combines optical spectra from eBOSS and infrared spectra from JWST to characterize emission lines in high-redshift quasars. |

More SDSS notebooks will be coming soon!
