    "The SDSS Legacy Spectra Survey is an optical-wavelength spectroscopic survey of millions of stars, galaxies, and quasars available through the [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/sdss). This includes data from the original [SDSS Legacy Spectra](https://classic.sdss.org/legacy/) survey, the [SDSS Supernova Survey](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/supernova/), and the [Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE)](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/segue/), which targeted over 400,000 stars in the Milky Way with a goal of mapping out the galactic disk in abundance space. A summary of the SDSS data products available at MAST can be found in the [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST User Manual](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/SDSS/Legacy+Spectra+Data+Products).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data products from the SDSS Legacy Spectra survey and SEGUE extensions are optical-wavelength (380-920 nm) spectra with a resolution of (λ/δλ)~2000 obtained using the SDSS-I/-II Spectrograph on the SDSS-2.5m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006) at Apache Point Observatory. In this notebook, we will show how to download SEGUE data from MAST, plot a spectrum, and classify a star based on its spectral type!\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1912, astronomer Annie Jump Cannon developed a method to classify stars based on the appearance of their spectrum, which is still used today. Stars are classified as O, B, A, F, G, K, or M based on the strength and location of absorption lines in their spectrum. [[1]](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1912AnHar..56..115C) These classifications also correspond to stellar temperature: O-type stars are the hottest stars, with surface temperatures of >30,000 K, while M-type have the coldest temperatures of < 3000 K. Our Sun is a G-type star. In this notebook, we will explore different stellar types and what their spectra look like. \n"

In 1912, astronomer Annie Jump Cannon developed a method to classify stars based on the appearance of their spectrum, which is still used today. Stars are classified as O, B, A, F, G, K, or M based on the strength and location of absorption lines in their spectrum. [[1]](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1912AnHar..56..115C) \n",
