    "This tutorial demonstrates how to retrieve Roman Supplementary & Telemetry data and use it in the context of a Python session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Roman Supplementary & Telemetry Data](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/spaces/RAPD/pages/308839208/Obtain+Supplemental+and+Telemetry+Data) tutorial in the Roman Pre-Launch documentation (restricted access pre-launch) describes how to access these supplementary & telemetry data available from MAST through the Calibration and Supplemental Search Interface (CaSSI). These data may be searched by ingestion date, file type, or filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supplementary and telemetry data available from CaSSI covers a variety of data products (including Level 0 products for WFI/CGI, housekeeping ancillary telemetry data, observatory predicted/observed ephemeris, and message logs). Because of the variety of data products, this tutorial focuses on demonstrating how to query CaSSI to obtain file counts or lists and how to download data from CaSSI.   This notebook assumes that if you are searching CaSSI, you know (generally) what you are looking for; no demonstration of how to work with the retrieved data is included.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this folder includes a companion script; after completing the tutorial, this offers a compact, customizable way to query, count, or download supplementary data. Examples using the various options in this script are given at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\" style=\"color:black; border-color:teal;\">\n",
    "Please note that pre-launch, <b>the MAST Roman CaSSI Search API requires authorization to search and download Roman data products.</b> Before we get started, please ensure that:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- ***you are authorized to search and download Roman engineering data from MAST.*** If you are not authorized but you think you should be, email the helpdesk at archive@stsci.edu\n",
