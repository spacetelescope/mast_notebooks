# Intro

## What is Astroquery?
[Astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a suite of tools for querying online astronomical data sources. There are many modules, each of which are designed to access different datasets, from ALMA to VizieR. The notebooks in this folder use the `astroquery.mast` module to query for data in the MAST Archive.

Releases of astroquery are coordinated by the [astropy project](https://www.astropy.org/index.html).

## For Further Reading
The [`astroquery.mast` readthedocs](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html) is a great resource for new users. The first half of the readthedocs page is reproduced in the 'beginner_search' notebook.
