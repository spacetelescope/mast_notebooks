    "# Surveying dust structure via GALEX MIS\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is to create a UV mosaic of a high-latitute cloud, using data from GALEX. We'll query the MAST Archive for Observations, then use the data to create a composite image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand UV images and how they are useful to study dust\n",
    "- Create masks for circular images\n",
    "- Create a mosaic from several images using WCS\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**GALEX background**: The [Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/galex) was a satellite designed to investigate star formation. It observed the sky in two different bands: in the Near UV (NUV) ($1750-27504$ Å) and in the Far UV (FUV) ($1350-1750$ Å). The GALEX database contains over 600 million source measurements in the ultraviolet domain, with some sources having more than one measurement, making them useful for studying their variable sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "**GALEX Medium Imaging survey (MIS) background**: Single orbit exposures (1,500s) of 1000 square degrees in positions that match the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These images present a higher resolution in comparison with AIS, since their exposure time was longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clouds can be visible in UV when they are found close to hot stars. The objective of this tutorial is to extract and display an intensity map image of a high-latitude cloud retrieved from GALEX MIS. High-latitude clouds (Galactic latitude: $|b| > 20-30º$) are interesting because they are considered ideal candidates to study triggered star formation.\n",

There are a few [imaging surveys](http://galex.stsci.edu/doc/CTM/wiki/Public_documentation/Chapter_2.html#GALEX_Science_Surveys) we could choose from, but MIS will give us good coverage of the cloud with a longer exposure time than the all-sky survey. [GALEX has two detectors](http://galex.stsci.edu/doc/CTM/wiki/Public_documentation/Chapter_1.html#Detectors), so let's also choose the Near UV with `filters=\"NUV\"`. Since we're just looking to create a mosaic, it doesn't matter too much which filter we pick; you might have a valid scientific reason to prefer one over the other."
