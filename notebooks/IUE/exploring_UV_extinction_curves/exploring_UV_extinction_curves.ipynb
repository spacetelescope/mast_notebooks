    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to download IUE data using the [MAST Archive API, astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html). We'll obtain the spectra of two stars, one reddened and one not. We will use these spectra to construct and plot UV extinction curves. An extinction curve demonstrates the wavelength dependence of dust extinction. It compares the dust-free Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of a star to the observed SED. Normally these curves are created by plotting $k(\\lambda-V)$ versus $1/\\lambda$, with $\\lambda$ being the wavelength (see 'Useful Equations' below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Extinction is relevant in a diverse range of scenarios. Sometimes, dust is found very near the observed object, like in stars with disks or proto-stellar clouds. However, the target does not need to be intrinsically \"dusty\"; dust in a galaxy that is light-years from a target star might still block the line-of-sight view and impact the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, our data comes from the [International Ultraviolet Explorer](https://archive.stsci.edu/iue/) (IUE). IUE performed spectrophotometry in the wavelength range from 1150 Å to 3200 Å. MAST hosts these observations, which include more than 100,000 spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining some terms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color index**: difference between magnitude of a star in two different passbands, typically B and V. Symbol: $(B-V)$. \n",
    "- **Extinction**: absoption and scattering of light by dust and gas between an object and the observer. It is a measure of the interstellar reddening quantified by the difference between the magnitude of the band when observed through dust versus a dust-free environment. Symbol: $A(\\lambda)$.  \n",
    "- **Magellanic Clouds**: Irregular dwarf galaxies that orbit the Milky Way galaxy and are located in the southern celestial hemisphere. Two distinct groups can be differentiated: the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).\n",
    "- **Spectral type**: stellar classification from hotter (O stars) to cooler (M stars). Temperature defines a star's \"color\" and surface brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"extinction equation\" we'll use to create our plots:**\n",
    "- $k(\\lambda-V) = \\frac{m(\\lambda-V)-m(\\lambda-V)_o}{(B-V)-(B-V)_o} = \\frac{A(\\lambda)-A(V)}{A(B)-A(V)}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: the $x_o$ terms refer to the star that is nearly unaffected by dust, i.e. $(B-V)$ corresponds to the observed color index and $(B-V)_o$ to the color index if there were no extinction due to dust. The stars should have the same spectral type in order to perform this comparison._\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- - The [Fitzpatrick and Massa (1990) parametrization](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990ApJS...72..163F/abstract): this will be the parametrization that will be followed in this tutorial for extinction curves. This parametrization is a combination of three elements; a linear \"background term\"; a Lorentsian-like \"Drude\" profile for the 2175 Å bump, $D(x; \\gamma, x_o)$; finally, a far-UV curvature term, $F(x)$. The $x$ in the equation corresponds to $x = \\lambda^{-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    " k(x-V) = c_1 + c_2x + c_3D(x; \\gamma, x_o)+c_4F(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    " D(x; \\gamma, x_o) = \\frac{x^2}{(x^2-x_o^2)^2+x^2\\gamma^2}\n",
