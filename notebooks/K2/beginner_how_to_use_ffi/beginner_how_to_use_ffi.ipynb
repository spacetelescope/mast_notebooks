    "K2 reads out the entire frame of all its cameras once or twice per Campaign and stores them as full frame images.  The total size on sky of the Kepler field-of-view is ~116 square degrees, although a few of the 21 modules had failed before the start of the K2 mission.\n",

Each of these regions is referred to as a \"Campaign\", starting with Campaign 0 and ending with Campaign 19. There was also a special \"Engineering\" Campaign before Campaign 0 that lasted ~10 days.\n",
    "* HDU = Header Data Unit.  A FITS file is made up of HDUs that contain data and metadata relating to the file. The first HDU is called the primary HDU, and anything that follows is considered an \"extension\", e.g., \"the first FITS extension\", \"the second FITS extension\", etc.\n",

Note that all 84 modules are included in the FFI FITS file, even if some of them do not have image data.  Let's examine the structure of the FITS file using the astropy.fits `info` function, which shows the FITS file format in more detail.
