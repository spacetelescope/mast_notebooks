    "This Notebook is a replacement for a web-based footprint viewer. Eventually, footprint viewing functionality will be built into the [Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT)](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/astronomers-proposal-tool-apt); scientists intending to propose for observations should use APT. In the meantime, this Notebook is a useful \"quick look\" tool.\n",
