    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn the basic functionality of [astrocut](https://github.com/spacetelescope/astrocut)'s `CubeFactory`, `TicaCubeFactory`, and `CutoutFactory`. These 3 tools allow users to generate cubes and cutouts of TESS images. TESS image cubes are stacks of TESS full frame images (TESS FFIs) which are formatted to allow users to make cutouts with `CutoutFactory`. These cutouts are sub-images that will only contain your region of interest, to make analysis easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of generating cubes, and making cutouts from them, mimicks the web-based [TESSCut](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/) service. This tutorial will teach you to make cubes and cutouts that are customized for your specific use-cases, while also giving insight to how TESSCut calls upon astrocut to create cutouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the TESSCut service, there are _two_ different TESS FFI product types you can work with in this notebook. These two product types are the TESS mission-provided, [Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) FFIs](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess), and the [TESS Image CAlibrator (TICA) FFIs](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica). Both are available via `astroquery.mast.Observations`, and both have different use-cases. The TICA products offer the latest sector observations due to their faster delivery cadence, and can be available up to 3 times sooner than their SPOC counterparts. As such, for those who are working with time-sensitive observations, TICA may be the best option for generating your cutouts. Note that the SPOC and TICA products are processed through different pipelines and thus have different pixel values and WCS solutions. Please refer to the [SPOC pipeline paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016SPIE.9913E..3EJ/abstract) and the [TICA pipeline paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abd63a) for more information on the differences and similarities between the SPOC and TICA products.\n",
