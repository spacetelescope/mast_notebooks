# TESS FFIs

These notebooks dive a little deeper into TESS [Full Frame Images](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/data-products.html#full-frame-images) (FFIs). Since FFIs are so large, these tutorials focus on creating cutouts and doing additional analysis with those subsets.

| Overlay a Cutout of FFIs with DSS imaging | Create a cutout and light curve from an FFI, then overlay an image from DSS.                                                                                 |
| Create a TESS FFI Cutout using Requests   | This method of requesting cutouts may be informative, but has largely been superceded by the "Generating Cubes and Cutouts" tutorial in the astrocut folder. |
